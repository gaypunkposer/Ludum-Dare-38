# Ludum-Dare-38

Welcome to Super Galaxy Cosmo!

https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/super-galaxy-cosmo

This was a game created in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare competition. As per the rules, this is the published source code.
Most assets were created from scratch in that 48 hours. The exceptions are as follows:
  Unity's Post Processing Stack - Went unused in the final game, but the source is still there
  Unity's Standard Assets - Several objects sample textures provided in the Standard Assets, not in any hugely noticable way, but they do.
  UCLA Game Lab's Wireframe Shader - The Wireframe Single-Sided Cutout shader was heavily modified to do some additional shadery-type effects
