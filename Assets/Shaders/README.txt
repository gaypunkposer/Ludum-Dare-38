These shaders are basaed on the Wireframe Single-Sided Cutout shader provided by UCLA Game Lab

It's been modified in the following ways:
	A vertex Sine wave distortion
	Edges no longer sample a texture
	Added texture and color to space between edges
	Added a color multiplier to work alongside Post Processing bloom
	Texture scrolling

As far as I understand, and I may be entirely wrong, this would count as derrivative work. Plz don't sue me if it doesn't tho. I like having a couple of meals a week and the occasional hot shower.
